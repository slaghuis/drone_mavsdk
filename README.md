# drone_mavsdk
Base controller, exposing ROS2 interface to MAVSDK to control drone in local flight.  This node depends on the drone_interfaces package.

# Status
Test scripts run 100% in a simulator environment.  Code is stable.
Next Test : Compile on a Raspberry Pi, followed by a live flight test

# Caution
This one has not flown.  (I fried the Raspberry Pi trying to get it to speak to the flight controller.)
